# connectK
In class project connectK

My work is in the file AI_Shell.cpp, which includes the code of an AI chess player. Other codes are provided by professor. 
The AI Chess player cannot be executed alone, it is supposed to be integraded with a connectK chess game, and AI_Shell.cpp only
reads the chess board from game and output the moves back to game in the form of coordinates.
